It's official. I now know how to program a robotic car.

It was not easy by any means, but I aced Udacity's seven-week class, [CS373: Programming a Robotic Car](http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012). I spent a few hours a week on homework and a few hours a week on classwork, with the seventh week being the final exam. 

I had to brush up on some math concepts I started to forget, like matrix arithmetic and probabilities, but I was able to get through, thanks to the [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). Some of the topics I learned about were:

* [Markov localization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization)
* [Kalman Filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
* [PID Controllers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)
* [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)
* [A* Pathfinding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_star)
* [Dynamic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

All in all, I learned a ton and I'm looking forward to trying out some of these concepts with quadcopters. I wish Udacity the best of luck and I'm looking forward to new and exciting classes from them and I hope they make Computer Vision one of them.
