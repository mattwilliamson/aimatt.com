Got borked PCBs that didn't quite work out? Great! Instead of just taking up space, just turn them into useful coasters to protect that [Parnian](http://www.parnian.com/desk.shtml) desk of yours.

Take your PCB (that will fit your favorite mug).

Stick some self adhesive pads on the bottom

Easy enough.

Go forth and sell them on [Etsy](http://etsy.com) or [Tindie](http://tindie.com)!
